            To all irregular students (those who have failed subjects):

            Double-check your curriculum. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are taking the correct subjects. Be strategic with the subjects you enroll in.

            I do not want a situation where, on your graduation day, you will ask for help because you are missing subjects. Familiarize yourself with the curriculum and the required prerequisites.

            The population of BSCpE is more than 100 students — do not expect me to know all your individual deficiencies. I will not entertain unacceptable excuses like, "Sir, I forgot," or "Sir, I didn’t know." It is your responsibility as a BSCpE student.

            If you want to graduate on time, make the effort to approach me. I am willing to assist those who take their academic progress seriously.

            Once you have failed a subject, you are automatically considered irregular — regardless of what is reflected in ERS. If you are unsure about your status, do not simply assume everything is fine.

            If you attempt to hide your failure status, I assure you: **you will not graduate on time.**

            Take ownership of your education.

  Indi ko gusto nga sa graduation pa kamo mangayo bulig kay kulang pa kamo subject.
